		<h1>My dear future wife,</h1>
		<br>
I know you will be surprised upon receiving this letter. Yes, it is real.<br>

Piya, because of you I no longer feel alone,<br>
Because of you, I look forward to waking up each day, just to look at your face,<br>
Because of you, I can complete myself. 
<br><br>
I still remember the first time we met, you were so beautiful that my heart melted. Your eyes are sparkling like stars; your hair fell perfectly on your face. I was all sweaty and nervous when I saw you first time at the inquiry desk and then we saw "Romance king dev patel"  FOR THE FIRST TIME SHARING ONE HANDSFREE. That day I decided there is not a thing I would change in you because you are amazing just the way you are.
	<br> <br>
<br>From yours and only yours JUJU<br>Love you to the moon and back ❤️<br>
