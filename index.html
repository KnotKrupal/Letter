		<p>    Dear Manjot & Purva, It has come to my attention that I haven't properly greeted you. but you guys were planning a trip and we had an unknown guest named tauktae and bla bla bla (boring)...  Now, you guys are home and I am free too, So since I haven't had your consent to write you a physical letter, here's something alternative! an E-letter! <br><br>

			It isn't often that you come across a person who you click with almost immediately. Most friendships take a long time to grow and become something special. Ours, however, is slightly different. I don't think I will ever be able to put into words how grateful and lucky I feel that our paths have crossed. I would try, but I don't think there's a word in English that would suffice.<br><br>
			As I get to know you guys better through rudri, I become more and more excited to see what our future adventures have in store for us. I always look forward to seeing you both!
			In our short time as friends, Although it hasn't been very long, you both seem to always have a way to keep me positive, motivated, happy, and focused on what matters (via rudri ofc). Finding someone who I can completely be myself around has been something very rare and very important to me, and I'm so glad you guys could be that person. <br><br>
			I know that whenever something good happens in either of our lives, the other one will be terhe to cheer us on; and whenever something not too great happens, you guys will always have your hands to hold or shoulders to cry on I won't be a part of it but oh boii I'll always be there singing songs and dancing like a PROFESSIONAL! <br>se feliz mi amigo!<br><br><br>
